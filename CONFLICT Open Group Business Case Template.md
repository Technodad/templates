## Background ##

This section briefly sets the scene and should include:
* An explanation of why the need for the expenditure exists, for example a requirement to update or replace technology due to obsolescence; pressing customer requirement; conformance with other external requirements e.g. legal, tax etc. The business need should be expanded upon in the next section so should only be briefly covered here by way of introduction* A clear statement of the justification for proceeding with the XYZ program, showing why the forecast expenditure of money, effort and time will be worthwhile over the expected life of the capabilities or other assets being created* Alternative courses of action – what happens if we do nothing? Are there other alternatives? If so why have they been discounted?* Describe any benchmarking (internal and/or external) that may have been done to verify the costs and benefits included in this business case
## Business Need ##

This section should cover, for example:
* Why the need for the expenditure exists; see background section. More detail should be included here* How the expenditure fits in with company and business unit strategy. Provide references to strategic plans/other suitable references if appropriate* Is the expenditure in the Operating Plan?* Are any proposed benefits in the Operating Plan?

## Project Description ##

The key points of the project that have a bearing on the business case – including:
* The key phases of the project, with a short description of each * The expected life of assets or capabilities to be created – and thus the time over which the benefits will be realized* The project’s physical or organizational boundaries, limitations and exclusions* Any known financial, technical, legal or political constraints## Benefits ##

The benefits are the desirable outcomes that should result from the execution of the project.  All types of benefit should be identified. These should include:
* Financial benefits – those that can reasonably be expressed in money terms – e.g. extra revenue or lower operating costs* Non-financial but measurable benefits – benefits that cannot sensibly be expressed in financial terms but can still be measured – e.g. market share, reduced number of complaints, higher staff satisfaction* Intangible benefits – benefits which cannot reasonably be measured, but are still valuable – e.g. improved reputation, greater management control.* Financial benefits and other measurable benefits can be displayed in the form of tables (consider two tables, one in the Financial Analysis section and the other for non-financial but measurable benefits).Financial benefits are the easiest to understand and to compare against costs, but non-financial and intangible often have the greatest long-term benefit to the business. Wherever possible intangible benefits should be converted into measurable benefits, and measurable benefits into financial benefits. One way to achieve this might be to demonstrate the cost of delivering the required capabilities/facilities by traditional (e.g. manual) means. For example, a benefit of a document management system might be easier access to management information, resulting in better management decision-making. The value of this could be demonstrated by calculating the cost of providing the same information manually (i.e. with a team of filing clerks).
Benefits should be expressed in a way that enables their achievement to be measured or demonstrated – e.g.:* ‘this will eliminate the need to renew software licences for the legacy systems being replaced worth £250,000 pa’ – a financial benefit* ‘this will reduce the average amount of time spent by our 500 project managers by ½ hour per day – equating to an overall saving in time of 7,300 person days per annum’ – a measurable but non financial benefit* ‘this will give the group a single recognised ‘logo’ and marketing image, which has long been a strategic ambition of the board’ – an intangible benefit
## Financial Analysis ##


## Risk Analysis ##
Provide a risk analysis, showing how the realisation of the various expected benefits might be impacted by each risk. One way of providing this would be to use a table:

##Key Assumptions

Show the key assumptions used in this business case, including the bases of all estimates of benefits and costs.
If there are some assumptions that have a significant impact on the costs or benefits, a sensitivity analysis should be presented – i.e. how a change to this factor would impact the level of benefits. Contingency allowances should be used to account for variations in risk.
