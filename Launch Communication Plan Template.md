# Launch Communication Plan for [Forum] #

## Introduction ##

This document is a plan for the communications activities around the launch of a new Forum or activity within The Open Group. It includes  key announcement messages, a detailed weekly timeline of activities leading up to the announcement date of a launch at an Open Group event. It identifies the key actors from both member organizations and Open Group staff as well as key analyst and media targets. 

The [Timeline and Activities] section serves as both a timeline for planing and a checklist to ensure all activities are complete.

## Launch Event Planning ##

We have a tried and tested formula for launching new programs, whether these are new formations, launching a certification program for an existing activity, or other major change. This approach is based on having our major publicity push taking place at an Open Group conference, and "opening for business" far enough before that conference so that we can demonstrate support and market uptake at the event through certified products or people, supporters on stage etc. 

Planning for such a launch occurs in several stages:

1.  The Forum Director works with VP Marketing to define launch plan, including "open for business" or "soft" launch, and formal launch
1. Schedule formal launch to take place during a Open Group conference, allowing adequate lead time for conference planning - > 3 months.
2. Let key potential customers know we are "open for business" and sign up initial customers, e.g, Forum members, entities getting certified etc. This stage ensure sufficient time to complete signups, certifications as needed.
3. Recruit and confirm key supporters or early / pilot customers to speak at launch event or provide testimonials to give evidence of adoption.
4. Create and approve public launch materials
5. Execute launch and communications plan
