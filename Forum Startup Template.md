# Forum Startup Checklist #


## Introduction ##

This document is a checklist for qualifying and starting up a new Forum, Vertical or Managed Consortium at The Open Group. It consists of three related parts: 

* [Forum Startup] - An overarching list of operational activities for starting up
* [Formation Qualification] - Detailed guidelines on qualifying the opportunity during the qualification step
* [Launch Event Planning] - The process for launch planning

## Forum Startup ##

This section contains the overarching checklist for progressing a new opportunity from startup to launch. This list is not meant to be a rigid project plan, and many activities can go on in parallel, particularly longer lead time items. Nevertheless, the steps are in roughly the right order to ensure success; in particular the business development activities should be done up front to ensure the project concept is sound and executive approvals are in place before expending too much resource or mis-setting expectations with customers.

[Formation Checklist]

## Formation Qualification  ##

When we find opportunities to create or bring activities under The Open Group umbrella, we should replicate the successful formation model we have used with FACE, Healthcare and others. In pursuing these, leads need to be qualified on whether they have the necessary characteristics that fueled other successes. We need to ensure **all** the following factors are in place:

|Formation Qualification Checklist|Approval| Lead Time |
|---------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
|*Market Demand Factors* |||
|☐ Buy-side leadership and involvement as a member- not just advisory participation|VP Channels | |
|☐ Clear procurement targets (with dates) and "pull" from buyers / acquiring agencies|VP Channels | |
|☐ A clear business transformation driver, e.g., needing to have a shrinking budget cover an expanding business/mission need. There must be a clear reason why vendors need to do business differently| VP Channels | |  
|☐ A set of vendors, including some market leaders, who are bought into the approach|  VP Channels| |
|☐ An acknowledgement from both sides that an open standard, backed by business/procurement guidance and a certification program, will be the catalyst for market change|  VP Channels| |  
|*Business Model Factors*|||
|☐ Fit with The Open Group brand, vision and mission, including openness and vendor neutrality|VP Marketing, CEO | |  
|☐ A sound business model based solely on membership revenue for long-term sustainability. We need to be confident in revenue >= $250K total revenue from the activity in the first year to afford a full-time Forum Director, and sufficient funding on top of that to support publicity, legal work etc. |CFO | |
|☐ Fit with other OG activities: Does the proposed activity overlap or conflict with an activity already underway in an existing Forum? Would this program benefit by working closely with other Forums, or is it better structured as an Industry Vertical or Managed Consortium?|CTO, CEO | |
|☐ Fit with our standards, consensus and governance model, including an understanding of whether the community needs a national gate or not| CTO| |  
|☐ Schedule, including any near-term drivers for formation/launch, roadmap for first standards etc.| CTO| |
[Qualification Checklist]

## Launch Event Planning ##

We have a tried and tested formula for launching new programs, whether these are new formations, launching a certification program for an existing activity, or other major change. This approach is based on having our major publicity push taking place at an Open Group conference, and "opening for business" far enough before that conference so that we can demonstrate support and market uptake at the event through certified products or people, supporters on stage etc. 

|Launch Event  Checklist|Approval| Lead Time |
|---------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|  
|☐ FD works with VP Marketing to define launch plan, including "open for business" or "soft" launch, and formal launch|VP Marketing|
|Schedule formal launch to take place during a Open Group conference| VP Mktg| 3 months|  
|☐ Let key potential customers know we are "open for business" and sign up initial customers, e.g, Forum members, entities getting certified etc.|VP Channels|Variable - but ensure sufficient time to complete signups, certifications as needed.|
|☐ Recruit and confirm key supporters or early / pilot customers to speak at launch event or provide testimonials to give evidence of adoption.| FD, VP Mktg| 3 months|  
|Create and approve public launch materials|VP Marketing, CEO|1 month|
